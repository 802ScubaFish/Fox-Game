To Play This Game, Simply Enter 'NPM Start' in Node

File Structure:

bg = backgrounds / buttons / icons
pet = individual pet states
sprite.css = all styling for the pet

Code Style:

I have set up prettier to auto format this project. 
The scripts are set up so that if there were any team members they could run 'npm run format' to auto format their own documents accordingly.

'npm run format:check' iterates over the javascript formatting similar to above.

Testing:

I've installed and added Jest to the scripts for testing purposes.
